"""
pipeline.py — orchestrates the full per-email workflow:

    classify -> (if BL_COMPARISON) locate SI+BL -> extract -> normalize
    -> compare -> decide (OK / MISMATCH / NEEDS_REVIEW)

This module has no FastAPI / database dependency so it can be run and unit
tested standalone (see backend/tests and backend/scripts/run_pipeline.py),
and is reused unchanged by the FastAPI background-task endpoints.
