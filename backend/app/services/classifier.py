"""
classifier.py — Email Classification AI

Classifies an email (subject + body) into exactly one of:

    BL_COMPARISON | SI_REQUEST | INVOICE_QUERY | GENERAL | SPAM

Strategy: weighted keyword rules over the subject and body, in line with the
locked "Rules + NLP + OpenAI fallback" AI strategy — the LLM is only
consulted when the rule engine is not confident, and only if an API key is
configured. This keeps the pipeline fast, deterministic and fully explainable
for the majority of traffic (real shipping-ops inboxes are extremely
template-driven), while leaving room to catch the long tail.

Returns: {"category": str, "confidence": float, "decided_by": "rule"|"llm"}
